    <string name="title_headline_introduction">Description</string>
    <string name="subtitle_headline_introduction">Robusta coffee, scientifically known as Coffea canephora, is one of the two primary species of coffee beans that dominate the global coffee market, the other being Arabica (Coffea arabica). Robusta coffee is renowned for its robust nature, strong flavor profile, and remarkable adaptability to diverse growing conditions. In this essay, we will delve into the world of Robusta coffee, exploring its origins, cultivation, distinctive characteristics, and its significant role in the coffee industry.</string>
    <string name="title_headline_origin">Origin and Cultivation</string>
    <string name="subtitle_headline_origin">Robusta coffee traces its roots to the central and western regions of sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in the areas that now constitute countries like Uganda, Congo, and Ivory Coast. Unlike its more delicate counterpart, Arabica, which thrives at higher altitudes and temperate climates, Robusta coffee flourishes in lower elevations and can endure a wider range of temperatures. This resilience has made it a favored choice for cultivation in regions where Arabica struggles to thrive, including lowland areas in Asia, Africa, and parts of South America.</string>
    <string name="title_headline_distinctive">Distinctive Characteristics</string>
    <string name="subtitle_headline_distinctive">One of the most defining characteristics of Robusta coffee is its flavor profile. Robusta beans tend to have a strong, bitter taste with a distinct nutty, woody, and earthy flavor. This robust flavor is partly due to its higher caffeine content, which can be almost double that of Arabica beans. The increased caffeine content also contributes to Robusta\'s natural resistance to pests and diseases, making it easier and less expensive to cultivate.</string>
    <string name="title_headline_industry">Role in the Coffee Industry</string>
    <string name="subtitle_headline_industry">Robusta coffee has a vital role in the coffee industry, primarily due to its hardiness and cost-effectiveness. It is often used in instant coffee production and as a filler in various coffee blends. Its higher caffeine content also makes it desirable for those seeking a quick energy boost. Moreover, Robusta\'s resistance to diseases and pests reduces the need for extensive chemical treatments, aligning with sustainable and environmentally friendly coffee farming practices.</string>

    <string name="dark_color">Dark roasted robusta coffee beans are characterized by a deep and dark brown to almost black coloration. The surface of the beans is notably shiny, reflecting light with a distinct sheen due to the generous amount of oils released during the extended roasting.
